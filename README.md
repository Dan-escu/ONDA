# Hardware Documentation

## Summary

A custom audio card has been designed for the Raspberry Pi 3, 
based on the Cirrus Logic WM8731 audio codec. The audio card features a built in microphone, an analogue line in and an analogue line out. It also features built in memory, in order to load the correct drivers once attached to a Raspberry Pi. The design of the audio card has been inspired by an open source project featuring a Raspberry Pi Zero form factor audio card, featured [here](https://github.com/skiselev/i2s_audio_phat).


## How to build

The schematic for the audio card is provided in this branch, along with clear outlines of both sides of the PCB. The schematic and PCB were designed in OrCAD and the raw files are available on request. ![](ONDA_HAT.JPG)
